  <h2>Constillations</h2>
  <p>A constellation is a group of stars that form a recognizable pattern or picture in the night sky, like Orion the Hunter or Leo the Lion. These patterns are not physically connected but appear to form shapes from Earth's perspective, with stars often at different distances from each other. Historically, constellations were used for navigation, tracking seasons, and in storytelling, often named after mythological figures, animals, or objects. Today, there are 88 officially recognized constellations that divide the entire celestial sphere, as defined by the International Astronomical Union.</p>
